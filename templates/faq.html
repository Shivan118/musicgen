                                    <p>The purpose of Sonic Serentiy is to make music therapy more accessible to more groups of people. Not only does putting the music therapy into a web or phone application make it easier for people who are already utilizing music as a form of therapy, and for music therapists  who can benefit from the recieving information regarding their patients music therapy session details to know their progress but this can also be beneficial for teachers and caretakers who are not musically trained themselves.
                                        This can be particularly helpful for those who are in more rural areas that do not have a great deal of access to many music therapists, having access to an app can help them open many more doors.</p>

                                <div class="ans">
                                    <p>The American Music Therapy Association (AMTA) actively supports extensive research into the benefits of music therapy, disseminating findings through publications like the Journal of Music Therapy, Music Therapy Perspectives, and other reputable sources. Additionally, a multitude of articles showcasing the efficacy of music therapy are available in medical and clinical journals worldwide, further underlining its effectiveness as a therapeutic modality.</p>

                                <div class="ans">
                                    <p>Music therapy is a complementary approach to medicine, working alongside traditional medical interventions to support holistic well-being. It acknowledges the interconnectedness of mind, body, and spirit, recognizing the therapeutic potential of music to address physical, emotional, cognitive, and social needs. By harnessing the inherent properties of music, such as rhythm, melody, and harmony, music therapy can enhance the effectiveness of medical treatments, promote relaxation, alleviate symptoms, and improve overall quality of life for individuals across diverse populations.</p>

                                <div class="ans">
                                    <p>Sonic Serenity uses solfeggio frequencies which are a set of 9 electromagnetic tones that are reputed to have the power to heal and raise consciousness. They form the basis of many ancient sacred music traditions dating back as far as the 8th century, such as the Gregorian chants and Indian Sanskrit chants as well as the Indian Classical Ragas. At the heart of solfeggio frequencies is the belief that the vibrational signature of certain sounds, ranging from 174 Hz to 963 Hz, can positively impact our mental, physical and spiritual health. For example, the 417Hz frequency can help remove negative energy from your aura and environment, can heal shame and anger based thinking. Both of these emotions are conducive to attracting negative outcomes and can aid in restful sleep.</p>

                                <div class="ans">
                                    <p>Music therapy offers a diverse array of interventions tailored to meet the individual needs and goals of clients. Through passive listening, clients experience relaxation and emotional release, while active engagement in songwriting fosters creativity and self-expression. Improvisation provides a space for spontaneous musical exploration, promoting communication and emotional processing. Instrument playing enhances motor skills and self-esteem, while lyric analysis facilitates insight and emotional exploration. Music and movement activities promote physical coordination and expression, while guided imagery aids in relaxation and personal growth. Whether through therapeutic singing, receptive listening, or guided relaxation, music therapy interventions harness the transformative power of music to promote holistic well-being and enhance quality of life.</p>

                                <div class="ans">
                                    <p>The common misconceptions are regarding safety and privacy. Yes, Solfeggio frequencies are  safe when used in music therapy practices. There is no evidence to suggest that listening to Solfeggio frequencies at appropriate volumes poses any risk to physical or mental health. However, as with any therapeutic intervention, it's essential for individuals to use caution and moderation, especially if they have underlying medical conditions or sensitivities. Further, the data of the user is shared only upon his consent by linking his account to that of their music therapists. The user data is saved only for the past 3 months from the current date and thereafter removed.</p>

                                <div class="ans">
                                    <p>Sonic Serenity detects emotion change in real time and will need you to stay in the frame. However, in case you do step away, it will provide music therapy based on the last emotion detected. Further, if you turn off the camera, sonic serenity will play the standard therapeutic track without personalisation and the progress report will not carry any details related to changes in emotions.</p>
